# 7 The Seventh Stage

Now I saw in my dream, that Christian went not forth alone; for there was one whose name was Hopeful (being so made by beholding of Christian and Faithful in their words and behavior, in their sufferings at the fair), who joined himself unto him, and entering into a brotherly agreement, told him that he would be his companion. Thus one died to bear testimony to the truth, and another rises out of his ashes to be a companion with Christian in his pilgrimage. This Hopeful also told Christian that there were many more of the men in the fair that would take their time and follow after.

So I saw, that quickly after they were got out of the fair, they overtook one that was going before them, whose name was Byends; so they said to him, What countryman, sir? and how far go you this way? He told them that he came from the town of Fairspeech, and that he was going to the Celestial City; but told them not his name.

From Fairspeech? said Christian; is there any good that lives there?

BY. Yes, said Byends, I hope so.

CHR. Pray, sir, what may I call you? said Christian.

BY. I am a stranger to you, and you to me; if you be going this way, I shall be glad of your company; if not, I must be content.

CHR. This town of Fairspeech, said Christian, I have heard of; and, as I remember, they say it's a wealthy place.

BY. Yes, I will assure you that it is; and I have very many rich kindred there.

CHR. Pray, who are your kindred there, if a man may be so bold?

BY. Almost the whole town; but in particular my Lord Turnabout, my Lord Timeserver, my Lord Fairspeech, from whose ancestors that town first took its name; also, Mr. Smoothman, Mr. Facingbothways, Mr. Anything; and the parson of our parish, Mr. Twotongues, was my mother's own brother, by father's side; and, to tell you the truth, I am become a gentleman of good quality; yet my great-grandfather was but a waterman, looking one way and rowing another, and I got most of my estate by the same occupation.

CHR. Are you a married man?

BY. Yes, and my wife is a very virtuous woman, the daughter of a virtuous woman; she was my Lady Feigning's daughter; therefore she came of a very honorable family, and is arrived to such a pitch of breeding that she knows how to treat every one, whether prince or peasant. 'Tis true, we somewhat differ in religion from those of the stricter sort, yet but in two small points; First, we never strive against wind and tide. Secondly, we are always most zealous when Religion goes in his silver slippers; we love much to walk with him in the street, if the sun shines and the people applaud him.

Then Christian stepped a little aside to his fellow Hopeful, saying, It runs in my mind that this is one Byends, of Fairspeech; and if it be he, we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth in all these parts. Then said Hopeful, Ask him; methinks he should not be ashamed of his name. So Christian came up with him again, and said, Sir, you talk as if you knew something more than all the world doth; and, if I take not my mark amiss, I deem I have half a guess of you. Is not your name Mr. Byends, of Fairspeech?

BY. This is not my name, but indeed it is a nickname that is given me by some that cannot abide me, and I must be content to bear it as a reproach, as other good men have borne theirs before me.

CHR. But did you never give an occasion to men to call you by this name?

BY. Never, never! The worst that ever I did to give them an occasion to give me this name was, that I had always the luck to agree in my judgment with the present way of the times, whatever it was, and my chance was to gain thereby: but if things are thus cast upon me, let me count them a blessing; but let not the malicious load me therefore with reproach.

CHR. I thought, indeed, that you were the man that I heard of; and to tell you what I think, I fear this name belongs to you more properly than you are willing: we should think it doth.

BY. Well, if you will thus imagine, I cannot help it; you shall find me a fair company-keeper, if you will still admit me your associate.

CHR. If you will go with us, you must go against wind and tide; the which, I perceive, is against your opinion: you must also own Religion in his rags, as well as when in his silver slippers; and stand by him, too, when bound in irons, as well as when he walketh the streets with applause.

BY. You must not impose, nor lord it over my faith; leave me to my liberty, and let me go with you.

CHR. Not a step farther, unless you will do, in what I propose, as we.

Then said Byends, I shall never desert my old principles, since they are harmless and profitable. If I may not go with you, I must do as I did before you overtook me, even go by myself, until some overtake me that will be glad of my company.

Now, I saw in my dream, that Christian and Hopeful forsook him, and kept their distance before him; but one of them, looking back, saw three men following Mr.Byends; and, behold, as they came up with him, he made them a very low bow; and they also gave him a compliment. The men's names were, Mr. Holdtheworld, Mr. Moneylove, and Mr. Saveall, men that Mr. Byends had formerly been acquainted with; for when children they were schoolfellows, and were taught by one Mr. Gripeman, a schoolmaster in Lovegain, which is a market-town in the county of Coveting, in 
the North. The schoolmaster taught them the art of getting, either by violence, cheating, flattering, lying, or by putting on a guise of religion; and these four gentlemen had attained much of the art of their master, so that they could each of them have kept such a school themselves.

Well, when they had, as I said, thus saluted each other, Mr. Moneylove said to Mr. Byends, Who are they upon the road before us? For Christian and Hopeful were yet within view.

BY. They are a couple of fellow-countrymen, that, after their mode, are going on pilgrimage.

MONEY. Alas! why did they not stay, that we might have had their good company? for they, and we, and you, sir, I hope, are all going on pilgrimage.

BY. We are so, indeed; but the men before us are so rigid, and love so much their own notions, and do also so lightly esteem the opinions of others, that let a man be never so godly, yet if he agrees not with them in all things, they thrust him quite out of their company.
